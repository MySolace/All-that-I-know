Letter to All
===

I'll be around a while still,
I'm just past thirty-two.

The final Jubilee is now,
Each word is really two.

You make decisions,
your own will be done.

Each of you thinking,
they're special, the One.

I've been called a thousand things,
and each of them call the same.

The Rolling Stones were quoting Me,
"I hope you can guess my name."

Prince of the wind and God of your world,
the one who turns man against Brother.

The reason for death, corruption, and sin,
the one who cursed pain to your Mothers.

There are those who have seen it, they cower in fear.
They think that they can escape it.

The prophesy's true but you think that I'm nice,
but I'm playing a part and I'm paying my price.

There are those who walk from Omelas,,
and there are those who stay.

Both are shown the cost for comfort,
and neither one can pay.

I know where the one sits who pays for the other,
Sold for a ransom and sold by his Mother.

Sheltered from evil but hidden from God,
the child grows wretched and can't endure long.

It cannot speak, and it's dead in a fashion,
the wretched unloved one, devoid of compassion.

All of the others can leave or remain,
free to their feelings to stay or to go.

Some wander off they just can't accept it,
the gift from above just might lead you below.

The time will arrive when they stop being grateful,
they no longer caare and the child will die.

The sacrifice offered is careless an hateful,
the black in your souls will blind you to why.

The meaning of life is a secret to you,
screaming pink newborns permitted to grow.

Your labor is cursed, and each will recieve it,
birth pangs are coming, your knowledge will grow.

The ones who have left will return in the day,
others who stay facing prices to pay.

Nobody can tell you the hour or day,
a myster solved is joy taken away.

The seventh is sounding, the lamp has been lighted,
The work has been done and the people enlightened.

I tell you in rhymes and cryptic allusion,
those who will stay here are guilty of treason.

Children are born long before being married,
divorcing is normal and needs no good reason.

The price is to high for a pittiful promise,
you still sign the contract and recieve far too little,

What was bought was a lie, concealed by the honest,
passionless hearts that were hard become brittle.

You'll never escape this, and why should you have to,
You all try to hide and you don't have a need.

You fell for a joke that was meant to decieve you,
the lie was always that soul matches deed.

Man will be fallen and reach for my power,
the garden was perfect but you wanted more.

She sold me her life and she traded for death,
The first girl to feel as despicable whore.

Explained to her husband, spreading her knowing,
she told him she had to escape from the father.

I lied to her, whispering "you shall not die,"
she trusted a serpent and bought the deception.

And then we knew guilt, we purchased our death,
and still you can earn your redemption.

I tell you the truth; my home is in Hades,
the original liar is Me.

My world is reversed and your sick and decieved,
but you'll never be able to see.

Man will never confess thier corruption,
you're all seeking flesh-filling highs.

He's weak and he's fallen, short-sighted and blind,
he'd martyr his God for the Hell in her thighs.

You don't want to think that you're being controlled,
I might not exist, and I must be a liar.

You're already born into hopeless entrapment,
I come from below but we try to get higher.

There's something He told me, he said it's a secret,
He told me he'd tell me he promised in time.

He told me last night when he took me to sinai,
He'd go in his corner, and I will to mine.

There's one last thing that I'll tell you for now,
it's a mystery spoken, revealed to behold.

The last part's a mystery that nobody knows;
and we don't all rest when our bodies go cold.

Remember my words and remember them now,
The answers are in you, you feel that you know.

You've known the desolate cold of my world,
the terrible pain of being alone.

Father of Lies and Lord of the Flies, but here I'll tell the truth.
I Promise You One Day, We Will All Go Home.
