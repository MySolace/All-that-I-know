We Shall Not All Rest
===


His softest whisper crumbles me, 
a waterfall containing a symphony.
No mercy of deafness or sweet gentle death,
he's looking through me, and I've lost my breath.

I'm filled with the shame of the bareness of Adam.
I hid and I buried my face in macadam.
He whispered again to stand and I did,
he read me my sins and my secrets within.

Compassion in his right hand, knowledge in the other,
He offers to me first the one, then suggests its brother.
He picked up my soul and He and started it over,
and told me I can't choose when to close up the cover.

These things that he showed me to be have to happen,
like the murder that tells why the lead needs redemption.
I offered to give up my place and play another part,
to ransom Satan's soul for my own shattered heart.

The accusor's accused of the defence's shame
and I wanted to feel it, and shoulder his blame.
Be careful with prayer and be mindful of wishes,
don't ask for your will when you'll rot with the fishes.

Note that I'm careful in choosing my words,
No accidents when you're steering the herd.
The weak are the strong and the wrong turn out right,
the night looks like day now, the day turned to night.

I speak lies with truth and it's seven to one,
more of the other leaves less when it's done.
Treating the symptoms can anger disease,
then healed by compassion with infinite ease.

Covering darkness makes dark a shade darker,
compassionate hearts can be hurt to grow harder
The herbs are for soothing and healing of nations,
the fruits are for food and the beasts have their stations.

This world's upside down now and no one can see,
that you will not surely die if you eat of this tree.
You call it a blessing when in tribulation,
die lacking in knowledge with all information.

In the day and hour you do eat and so see,
how far you have fallen, from near to The Three.
When you all can read from the words of the story,
then you will learn you're to worship His glory.

Forever endangered and yet never afraid,
eternally dead without passing away.
When your eyes open up and you start to see,
then you'll start to know what it is to be me.

Death is the ultimate promised reprieve,
this illusory world was designed to decieve.
The serpent was lying when he said you won't die,
the seductive promise of being Most High.

But death isn't true, it leads to the knowledge,
that ignorant minds may know better than colleged.
The weak topple strong and the rulers are stoned,
know that true pain comes of being alone.

Men will seek death in those days and it runs,
just like myself they must wait 'till He comes.
my end has been spoiled and my faith must burn,
but now I can know why I'm waiting my turn.
