# Men Shall Seek Death #
### And it shall not come to them. ###

He whispered to me and it crumbled me,
a waterfall behind a too-loud symphony.

No mercy of deafness or saving of death,
he looked at me, and I knew not long is left.

I'm filled with the shame of the nudity of Adam.
I hid and I buried my face in macadam.

He whispered again, to stand and I did,
He read me my sins and my secrets within.

My love held in one hand, knowledge in the other,
He offered me one and suggested its brother.

He picked up my soul and He and started it over,
and told me I can't choose when to close up the cover.

These things that he showeed me to be have to happen,
like the murder that tells why the lead needs redemption.

I offered to give up the play for my part,
to ransom our Satan like God from my shattering heart.

Our accusations of us put his to shame,
I wanted to feel it, and shoulder his blame.

Be careful in prayer and mindful of wishes,
don't ask your will and surrender to fishes.

Note that I'm careful in choosing my words,
No accidents when you're steering the herd.

The weak are the strong and the wrong turn out right,
the night looks like day now, the day turned to night.

Like with the trueth and it's seven to one,
more of the other leaves less when it's done.

Treating the symptoms can anger disease,
it's healed by compassion with infinite ease.

Covering darkness makes dark things grow darker,
bring them to light and mark them with marker.

The herbs are for soothing and healing of nations,
the fruits are for food and the beasts take their stations.

It's all upside down now and no one can see,
you will not surely die if you eat of the tree.

You call it a blessing when in tribulation,
die lacking in knowledge with all information.

In the day and hour you eat and do see,
the way we have fallen from near to the three.

When we all can read from the words of the story,
then we will know how to worship His glory.

Never all here and never away,
eternally dying and no passing away.

When your eyes open up and you start to see,
then you'll know what it is to be me.

Death is the ultimate promised reprieve,
the illusory world was designed to decieve.

The serpent way lying when he told the girl why,
the ultimate seducation of not having to die.

But death isn't true an it leads to this knowledge,
that ignorant minds may know better than college.

The weak topple strong and the rulers are stoned,
from knowing comes the pain of being alone.

If the ending is spoiled then faith can burn,
but now I can know why I'm waiting my turn.
